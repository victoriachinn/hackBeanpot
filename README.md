# Inspiration
Drawing inspiration from Airbnb and Snap Maps, we set out to create a more casual and social take on vacation rentals. In college, it's common for friends to crash on each other’s couches when visiting new cities—especially in a place like Boston. We wanted to turn this everyday experience into a seamless, fun, and community-driven platform that makes finding and offering a place to stay as easy as checking a map.

# What CNBean does
Users start by logging in with their username and password. From there, they enter their travel destination, which takes them to an interactive map displaying available couch spaces from friends in that area. Each marker on the map represents a listing, where users can view details about the couch’s conditions and availability. With just a few clicks, they can request to rent—or "surf"—a couch, making travel more affordable and social.
